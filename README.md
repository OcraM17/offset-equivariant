# Offset equivariant networks

Pytorch implementation of offset equivariant networks

Offset equivariant networks have a predictable behavior in face of uniform changes of the input values.
In the log RGB space thsse networks are equivariant to global changes in the illumination.
This makes it easy to achieve, for instance, image recognition invariant wrt the color of the light source.
